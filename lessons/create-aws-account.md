How do I create and activate a new AWS account?
Last updated: 2022-02-28

I'm getting started with AWS. How do I create and activate a new AWS account?

**Resolution**
Sign up using your email address
Open the Amazon Web Services (AWS) home page.
Choose Create an AWS Account.
Note: If you signed in to AWS recently, choose Sign in to the Console. If Create a new AWS account isn't visible, first choose Sign in to a different account, and then choose Create a new AWS account.
In Root user email address, enter your email address, edit the AWS account name, and then choose Verify email address. An AWS verification email will be sent to this address with a verification code.
Tip: For Root user email address, use a corporate email distribution list (for example, it.admins@example.com) or email box if your account is a professional AWS account. Avoid using an individual's corporate email address (for example, paulo.santos@example.com). With this practice, your company can retain access to the AWS account even when an employee changes positions or leaves the company. The email address can be used to reset account credentials. Be sure that you protect access to these distribution lists. Don't use the AWS account root user login for your everyday tasks. It's a best practice to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the root account to secure your AWS resources.

Tip: For AWS Account name, use an account naming standard so that the account name can be recognized in your invoice or Billing and Cost Management console. If it's a company account, then consider using the naming standard of organization-purpose-environment (for example, ExampleCompany-audit-prod). If it's a personal account, consider using the naming standard of first name-last name-purpose (for example, paulo-santos-testaccount). You can change the account name in your account settings after you sign up. For more information, see How do I change the name on my AWS account?

**Verify your email address**
Enter the code you receive, and then choose Verify. The code might take a few minutes to arrive. Check your email and spam folder for the verification code email.

**Create your password**
Enter your Root user password and Confirm root user password, and then choose Continue.

**Add your contact information**
Select Personal or Business.       
Note: Personal accounts and business accounts have the same features and functions.
Enter your personal or business information.
Important: For business AWS accounts, it's a best practice to enter the company phone number rather than a personal cell phone number. Configuring a root account with an individual email address or a personal phone number can make your account insecure.
Read and accept the AWS Customer Agreement.
Choose Continue.
You receive an email to confirm that your account is created. You can sign in to your new account using the email address and password that you registered with. However, you can't use AWS services until you finish activating your account.

**Add a payment method**
On the Billing information page, enter the information about your payment method, and then choose Verify and Add.

If you are signing up in India for an Amazon Web Services Private Limited (AWS Inida) account, then you must provide your CVV as part of the verification process. You might also have to enter a one-time password, depending on your bank. AWS India charges your payment method two Indian Rupees (INR), as part of the verification process. AWS India refunds the two INR after the verification is complete.

If you want to use a different billing address for your AWS billing information, choose Use a new address. Then, choose Verify and Continue.

Important: You can't proceed with the sign-up process until you add a valid payment method.

**Verify your phone number**
On the Confirm your identity page, select a contact method to receive a verification code.
Select your phone number country or region code from the list.
Enter a mobile phone number where you can be reached in the next few minutes.
If presented with a CAPTCHA, enter the displayed code, and then submit.
Note: To troubleshoot CAPTCHA errors, see What do I do if I receive an error when entering the CAPTCHA to sign in to my AWS account?
In a few moments, an automated system contacts you.
Enter the PIN you receive, and then choose Continue.
Choose an AWS Support plan
On the Select a support plan page, choose one of the available Support plans. For a description of the available Support plans and their benefits, see Compare AWS Support plans.

Choose Complete sign up.

Wait for account activation
After you choose a Support plan, a confirmation page indicates that your account is being activated. Accounts are usually activated within a few minutes, but the process might take up to 24 hours.

You can sign in to your AWS account during this time. The AWS home page might display a Complete Sign Up button during this time, even if you've completed all the steps in the sign-up process.

When your account is fully activated, you receive a confirmation email. Check your email and spam folder for the confirmation email. After you receive this email, you have full access to all AWS services.
